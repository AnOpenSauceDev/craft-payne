# Craft-payne

a proof-of-concept mod that messes with the new `tick` systems added in 1.20.3

This mod is practically begging for a projectile-based gun mod, one that i'm far too lazy to use a mod like geckolib to animate guns.

This code could easily be modified into a different bullet-time system from any other game (e.g. SUPERHOT) with pretty minimal effort.
